# 422 Error Fix - Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The **422 Unprocessable Entity** error when uploading files to `/api/v1/analysis/unified` has been completely fixed.

## 🔍 Problem

Frontend was sending FormData with three separate fields:
- `technical_files`
- `quantities_files`  
- `drawings_files`

But backend was expecting a single `files` parameter, causing FastAPI to reject the request with 422.

## 🛠️ Solution

Updated the backend endpoint signature to match the frontend FormData structure:

```python
# app/routers/unified_router.py
@router.post("/unified")
async def analyze_files(
    technical_files: Optional[List[UploadFile]] = File(None),
    quantities_files: Optional[List[UploadFile]] = File(None),
    drawings_files: Optional[List[UploadFile]] = File(None)
):
```

## 📊 Testing

All tests pass with 100% success rate:

| Test Scenario | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Multiple files from all panels | ✅ PASS |
| Only technical files | ✅ PASS |
| Invalid file types | ✅ PASS |
| Empty request | ✅ PASS |
| Mixed file extensions | ✅ PASS |
