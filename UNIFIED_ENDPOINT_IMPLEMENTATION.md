# Unified Endpoint Migration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the `/api/v1/analysis/unified` endpoint to use FastAPI's native `UploadFile`/`List[UploadFile]` with multipart/form-data support, MIME type validation, and secure file storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Services Created

#### `app/services/validation.py`
- **Purpose**: Validates uploaded files for MIME type and size
- **Key Features**:
  - MIME type validation per field type (technical, quantities, drawings)
  - File size validation (50 MB limit, configurable via env)
  - Proper error messages with HTTP 400 responses
  - Supports content-type detection from both header and filename

**MIME Types by Field:**
- **technical**: PDF, DOCX, TXT
- **quantities**: XLSX, XLS, PDF, XML
- **drawings**: PDF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, DWG, DXF

#### `app/services/storage.py`
- **Purpose**: Handles secure file storage with sanitized filenames
- **Key Features**:
  - Generates UUID for each analysis
  - Sanitizes filenames to prevent security issues
  - Creates directory structure: `storage/{user_id}/uploads/{analysis_id}/`
  - Handles duplicate filenames by appending numbers
  - User ID: 1 for valid Bearer token, 0 otherwise

### 2. Updated Router

#### `app/routers/unified_router.py`
**Changes:**
- Accepts both old and new field names for backward compatibility:
  - New: `technical_files`, `quantities_files`, `drawings_files`
  - Old: `project_documentation`, `budget_estimate`, `drawings`
- Added Authorization header support (Bearer token)
- New response format:
  ```json
  {
    "analysis_id": "uuid",
    "status": "processing",
    "files": {
      "technical_files": [...],
      "quantities_files": [...],
      "drawings_files": [...]
    }
  }
  ```
- Integrated validation and storage services
- Proper error handling with HTTP 400 for validation failures

### 3. Updated Documentation

#### `README.md`
Added comprehensive section "Unified Analysis Upload (multipart/form-data)" with:
- Field descriptions and allowed MIME types table
- Response format examples
- Error response examples
- Storage location details
- Multiple usage examples:
  - Swagger UI instructions
  - curl examples (single/multiple files, both field name sets)
  - Python requests example

### 4. Test Suite

#### `tests/test_unified_multipart.py`
Created 13 comprehensive tests covering:
- ✅ New field names (technical_files, quantities_files, drawings_files)
- ✅ Old field names (project_documentation, budget_estimate, drawings)
- ✅ MIME type validation (rejects invalid types)
- ✅ File size validation (rejects files > 50MB)
- ✅ Valid MIME types for each field type
- ✅ Multiple files in same field
- ✅ Response structure validation
- ✅ Authentication (with/without Bearer token)
- ✅ Cross-field MIME type rejection

**All 13 tests passing ✓**

## Key Features

### 1. Dual Field Name Support
```bash
# New field names
curl -F "technical_files=@file.pdf" ...

# Old field names (backward compatible)
curl -F "project_documentation=@file.pdf" ...
```

### 2. MIME Type Validation
```json
// Invalid MIME type returns 400
{
  "detail": "Invalid file type 'application/exe' for technical. Allowed: application/pdf, ..."
}
```

### 3. File Size Validation
```json
// File too large returns 400
{
  "detail": "File too large: 53477376 bytes (max 52428800 bytes / 50.0MB)"
}
```

### 4. Secure Storage
- Files saved to: `storage/{user_id}/uploads/{analysis_id}/`
- Filenames sanitized (removes special chars, prevents path traversal)
- UUID-based analysis ID
- User ID from Bearer token (1 for valid, 0 for none/invalid)

### 5. Swagger UI Integration
- Shows file upload buttons for each field
- Supports multiple file selection
- Clear field descriptions
- Authorization header input

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test 1: New field names ✓
curl -F "technical_files=@tech.txt" -F "quantities_files=@budget.xml" ...
Response: 200, analysis_id generated, files saved

# Test 2: Old field names ✓
curl -F "project_documentation=@tech.txt" -F "budget_estimate=@budget.xml" ...
Response: 200, works with old names

# Test 3: Invalid MIME type ✓
curl -F "technical_files=@malware.exe" ...
Response: 400, "Invalid file type 'application/octet-stream'"

# Test 4: File too large ✓
curl -F "technical_files=@51mb.txt" ...
Response: 400, "File too large: 53477376 bytes"

# Test 5: No auth token ✓
curl -F "technical_files=@file.txt" ...
Response: 200, files saved to storage/0/uploads/...

# Test 6: With auth token ✓
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mock_jwt_token_12345" -F "technical_files=@file.txt" ...
Response: 200, files saved to storage/1/uploads/...

# Test 7: Multiple files same field ✓
curl -F "technical_files=@file1.txt" -F "technical_files=@file2.txt" ...
Response: 200, both files saved
```

### Automated Testing
- Created: `tests/test_unified_multipart.py`
- Tests: 13 total
- Status: **All passing ✓**

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Maximum file size in MB (default: 50)
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=50

# Storage base directory (default: "storage")
STORAGE_BASE=storage
```

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
The response format has changed from the old format:
```json
// OLD
{
  "status": "success",
  "files": [...],
  "summary": {...}
}

// NEW
{
  "analysis_id": "uuid",
  "status": "processing",
  "files": {
    "technical_files": [...],
    "quantities_files": [...],
    "drawings_files": [...]
  }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Old field names still work (project_documentation, budget_estimate, drawings)
- Both sets of field names can be mixed in the same request
- Validation and storage work identically for both

## Files Modified/Created
